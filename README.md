# pancreatic-cancer-detection

This project aims to predict the likelihood of pancreatic cancer diagnosis based on various patient parameters. It utilizes machine learning models trained on a dataset containing information such as age, sex, cohort type, sample origin, creatinine level, LYVE1, and REG1B.

**Description
**The project consists of the following components:

Machine Learning Model: Trained using a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict pancreatic cancer diagnosis.
Flask Web Application: Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their parameters and get a prediction.
HTML Form: Allows users to input their parameters for prediction.

**Dependencies
**
Python 3.11
Flask
scikit-learn
joblib
pandas

**Usage
**To use the web application:
Clone the repository to your local machine:
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/MandeepSaluja/pancreatic-cancer-detection.git
